SOLID principle with Go

## Description
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, 
flexible, and maintainable.

### The SOLID ideas are
**1. Single-responsibility principle**: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." 
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

**2. Openâ€“closed principle**: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
    
**3. Liskov substitution principle**: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use 
    objects of derived classes without knowing it."

**4. Interface segregation principle**: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."

**5. Dependency inversion principle**: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes."

The SOLID principles apply to any object-oriented design, they can also form a core philosophy for methodologies 
such as agile development or adaptive software development.
